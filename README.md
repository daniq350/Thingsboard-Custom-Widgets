# Thingsboard-Custom-Widgets
This repository contains a collection of custom widgets that can be used in the open-source IoT platform ThingsBoard. These widgets have been developed to provide additional functionality and flexibility to the platform, and can be easily integrated into your existing ThingsBoard deployment.

Each widget can be imported individually (not a bundle file)

Widget 1: Telemetry export widget (export_telemetry.json)
Telemetry can be exported by selecting time range and entity. Also telemetry keys can be selected.
